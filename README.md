# my-repast-simphony
Custom build of Repast Simphony 2.2

### Introduction

Due to fact that I'm a heavy user of Repast Simphony, and: a) I'm allergic to the crappy SourceForge website b) my feature requests met a big enthusiasm but weren't implemented, I decided to make couple of additional features by myself and publish it here. I use it mostly for running multi-agent simulations on my university, which means I will be used for academic research, but maybe somebody more will find it helpful.

#### License

Same as in Repast Simphony 2.2

[Repast Suite License](http://repast.sourceforge.net/license.php)

#### Q&A
