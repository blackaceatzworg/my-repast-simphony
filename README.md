# my-repast-simphony
Custom build of Repast Simphony 2.2

### Introduction

Due to fact that I'm a heavy user of Repast Simphony, and: a) I'm allergic to the crappy SourceForge website b) my feature requests met a big enthusiasm but weren't implemented, I decided to make couple of additional features by myself and publish it here.

#### License

Same as in Repast Simphony 2.2

#### Q&A

* When it will be ready?
* As soon as possible :)
