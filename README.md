# my-repast-simphony
Custom build of Repast Simphony 2.2

### Introduction

Due to fact that I'm a heavy user of Repast Simphony, and: a) I'm allergic to the crappy SourceForge website b) my feature requests met a big enthusiasm but weren't implemented, I decided to make couple of additional features by myself and publish it here. I use it mostly for running multi-agent simulations on my university, which means It will be used for academic research, but maybe somebody more will find it helpful. Feel free to make feature requests by yourself in this repository.
